# Infinite-tic-tac-toe
an infinite board tic tac toe game made in python with pygame module

I made this game a long while ago while quarantined in order to play with a friend online
The code is was rushed and is an absolute mess...
Hope you enjoy the concept though :)


Game ends when a player gets 5 in a row
Move around with arrow keys
